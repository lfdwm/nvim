# Neovim setup

This branch contains an old base from which more tailored configs have been made.

Branches are organized into usecase: `usecase/<...>`

For generic config twiddling and datawrangling, see `usecase/system`

Otherwise, for language specific configs see `usecase/<lang>`, and for project specific see `usecase/<proj>` or `usecase/<lang>/<proj>`
